# staticport
## A static portfolio framework 

The idea is to take a bunch of folders with photos in them and build a static website to run on Amazon S3 or other static hosting platform.
Maybe it should be called jbof.

'staticport OPTIONS <rootdirectory>`

OPTIONS could be:
`-theme <sometheme>`
`-ignorenonimages`
